UFO Pilot

Overview
========
UFO Pilot is a sci-fi simulation showcasing a UFO navigating a futuristic cityscape. Built with OpenGL, the project features advanced lighting, textures, and dynamic movements. The scene includes several diverse glowing neon structures, textured buildings, an orbiting moonlight, and interactive UFO controls. The project highlights OpenGL's 3D rendering capabilities, lighting techniques, and texture mapping.

Features
========
1. Dynamic UFO Controls:
   - Navigate the UFO using arrow keys for movement and yaw (rotation).
   - Use 'W' and 'S' to move the UFO vertically.

2. Advanced Lighting:
   - A glowing moonlight orbits the scene, casting ambient, diffuse, and specular light.
   - Emissive lighting on neon edges and beams for a sci-fi atmosphere.

3. Textured and Modeled Scene:
   - The environment includes textured buildings, neon-emissive towers, and a metallic UFO.
   - A glowing, dynamic fog effect atop glowing helical towers simulates futuristic force fields.

4. Glowing Moonlight:
   - The moonlight acts as the light source and features an emissive glow for visibility.

5. Neo-Gothic Architecture:
   - Structures feature tessellated walls and neo-gothic spires, providing a detailed and immersive cityscape.

Controls
========
UFO Controls:
- Arrow Keys: Move the UFO forward/backward and rotate left/right.
- 'W'/'S': Move the UFO vertically up/down.

Exit:
- 'ESC': Exit the program.

Compilation
===========
To compile the program, run the following command in the terminal:
make
This will create an executable file named 'ufo_pilot'.

Execution
=========
Run the program with:
./ufo_pilot

Remaining Tasks in Order
===============
1. Textures:
   - Add more textures to various elements for enhanced realism.
   - Apply sci-fi patterns to buildings and objects.

2. Buildings/Structures:
   - Create additional futuristic and complex structures.
   - Introduce glowing, reflective, or hovering architectural elements.

3. Colorful Tunnel:
   - Add a vibrant, dynamic tunnel for the UFO to navigate through.

4. UFO Dynamics:
   - Enhance UFO movement and interactivity for advanced gameplay.
